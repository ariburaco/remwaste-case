Hi,

Thank you for the interest in the next steps.

Next Steps:

We’d love to see how you approach front-end development by working on a small React coding challenge.

The Process: 

We’ve provided a basic front-end page: Go to https://wewantwaste.co.uk/ then enter the postcode LE10 1SH and select an address, then select garden waste. On the next page you will see a skip select page which is the target page which we want you to redesign.

Your goal is to redesign the look and feel while keeping its functionality intact.

Focus on clean, maintainable react code, responsiveness, and UI/UX improvements.

You need to incorporate the page to display correctly on mobile web browser and desktop

Use the data from this link to populate the skip options https://app.wewantwaste.co.uk/api/skips/by-location?postcode=NR32&area=Lowestoft

How to Submit:

1.Create a public GitHub repository link

2.Make your changes and include a README file explaining your approach.

3.Create a sandbox link so you can submit your updated testable version by Tuesday (March 25, 2025) via this form: https://forms.gle/N6nKLgW8CMqZ2eFY8.

Our team will review submissions and we’ll reach out about the final interview.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Looking forward to seeing your work!
